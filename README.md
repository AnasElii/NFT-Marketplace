## Overview

NFT Marketplace is the front-end component of a full-stack decentralized application (dApp) designed to create a cost-efficient and secure marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This project serves as an educational resource for anyone interested in learning about building dApps and NFT marketplaces.

Please note that this is only the front-end portion of the project. You can find the **Blockchain-Integrated Backend Architecture**, which offers a ***hybrid backend*** combining both decentralized and centralized elements, [here](https://github.com/AnasElii/blockchain-integrated-backend-architecture).

For those interested in a ***fully decentralized backend***, you can utilize the **Serverless Backend**. This backend ensures the creation of a fully decentralized architecture, leveraging both ***The Graph Protocol*** for indexing and ***Pinata IPFS*** for decentralized file storage. You can find more details about it [here](https://github.com/AnasElii/Serverless-Backend).

## Features

- **Decentralized and Centralized Backend**: Combines the strengths of both decentralized and centralized systems to balance cost and performance.
- **Cost-Efficient Smart Contracts**: Designed to minimize gas fees and other costs associated with blockchain transactions.
- **Secure Transactions**: Emphasis on maintaining the security and integrity of the NFT store.
- **Technology Stack**: Utilizes Next.js and JavaScript for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and various databases, including MySQL, to manage and store data efficiently.
